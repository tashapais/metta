"""Handler configuration classes and helper functions.

This module provides a data-driven system for configuring handlers on GridObjects.
There are three types of handlers:
  - on_use: Triggered when agent uses/activates an object (context: actor=agent, target=object)
  - on_update: Triggered after mutations are applied (context: actor=null, target=object)
  - aoe: Triggered per-tick for objects within radius (context: actor=source, target=affected)

Handlers consist of filters (conditions that must be met) and mutations (effects that are applied).
